Hello my name is Thomas Doan. I am enrolled in Georgia Tech's Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS). I am currently attempting to make a career change into tech. Part of the reason for this blog is to get myself acquainted with various technologies and to keep track of my projects. Posts are going to mainly revolve around projects I've completed and the interesting bits of knowledge I've picked up along the way. On occasion I will post about my experience in the OMSCS program and about the transition to tech.
